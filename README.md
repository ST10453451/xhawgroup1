Empowering the nation designs report. 


Summary 

When designing the website and mobile application for empowering the nation, I made sure to follow the requirements on the project instructions. The difference between the website design and the mobile application design is that the website pages have headers and footers while the mobile application has the splash screen that shows the logo and then quickly shows the homepage. The homepage of the website has sections that follow the best practices of web design. For the logo we went with a green and brown logo that shows a book and a plant that symbolizes growth. The color palette we went with has brown, light green and a green that is darker 

 

Mobile Application designs 

As I have mentioned, the mobile application starts with a splash screen, showing the logo of empowering the nation. The second page is a home page showing the logo and name of empowering the nation, a paragraph introducing the organization and the types of courses they offer. When the user clicks on a course type they are going to be navigated to a list of courses with that duration. They also have an option to go back to choose a course with a different duration because the app has three navigation buttons on each page; a button that directs the user to the homepage, a page that directs them to the calculate total fees page and the one that directs them to the previous page. 

When they view the available courses, they have a choice to click on a course they are interested in to see more about the course {The purpose, the price, and the content). After the user browses the different courses offered, they will then be able to navigate to the ‘calculate total fees’ pages where they can select all the courses they are interested in, and then find out how much it will cost them to enroll. There are discounts offered based on the number of courses the user selected. The user will be able to fill in a form that lets them request a call back from an agent and find the contact details of 3 branches of empowering the nation in Johannesburg. The mobile app has 13 pages. 

To make the design aesthetically pleasing, we added three colorful rectangles to show three colors from our color palette, a brow navigation bar with three brown icons for the homepage, the previous page and the calculate total fees page. We sourced our images from pexels.com and unsplash.com 

 

Website design 

The website starts with a home page that has a header, a footer and four other sections; the hero section which hooks the user with a big image that has a message related to the website, a headline that pushes them to want to see and know more about the organization and a sub headline that gives a little more of what empowering the nation is about. The section after the hero section is an ‘about us’ section which shows an image of the founder and a message about the organization, how it started and what motivated the founder to start it. There is also a courses section which shows the two course durations available. When the user clicks on them, they are going to be navigated to a page showing a list of courses they selected. When they view the available courses, they have a choice to click on a course they are interested in to see more about the course {The purpose, the price, and the content). 

 After the user browses the different courses offered, they will then be able to navigate to the ‘calculate total fees’ pages where they can select all the courses they are interested in, and then find out how much it will cost them to enroll. There are discounts offered based on the number of courses the user selected. The user will be able to fill in a form that lets them request a call back from an agent and find the contact details of 3 branches of empowering the nation in Johannesburg. The website has 12 pages. The section after the courses section is a testimonials section, where people who studied there share good thoughts about the organization. The user will be able to navigate to different pages of the website using the header and a footer. This is an alternative to the navigation icons used on the mobile app.  

To make the design aesthetically pleasing, we added green and brown backgrounds to highlight different sections and brown backgrounds for buttons to have them popout. We sourced our images from pexels.com, crayion.com and unsplash.com 

 

 

Conclusion 

Overall, I think the designs I did for both the mobile app and the website will work well for the project because they are user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Every user from a different age group is going to be able to use them without any hassles. They follow the requirements of the assigned project and the best practices of web design.
